## My philosophy

I love **transparency** with users, **security** and **privacy** for them.  
**Learn to learn, teamwork** and I absolutely think that a nice working ambient is based on **companionship** and **confidence.**

## What do I do

Full stack development with **NodeJS** (express) and vanilla **JavaScript.** Programming with **C, Flutter** and **Kotlin.**

## How did I arrive here

For four years I have been studying computer programming in a self-taught way and since 2020 I have been studying at **42 Madrid Fundaci√≥n Telef√≥nica,** where I have learned to learn. I love challenges and therefore I am always willing to join one.

## What will I do

I will continue updating myself, just like I have done it until now, because in programming it is impossible to stay up-to-date if you don't keep learning new things.  
With expectations to learn **C++, informatic security** and **blockchain.**
